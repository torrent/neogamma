**Mitigation Implemented**  
To prevent further tampering, a content-based filter was added directly to `plugin/edit.inc.php`, just before the `page_write()` call. The filter blocks any edits to `Menubar` that contain known spam patterns.

The following logic was inserted:

— Begin inserted code (in plain text) —

Define a list of forbidden patterns:

- hoshikuzu660798  
- pixiv.net/users/660798  
- fanbox.cc  
- misskey.io/@hoshikuzu  
- discord.gg/  
- marshmallow-qa.com  
- skeb.jp/@  
- youtube.com/@hoshikuzu  
- x.com/hoshikuzu  

Then, before saving the page, check if the page is `Menubar`.  
If so, scan the `$postdata` for any of the forbidden patterns.  
If a match is found, block the edit and log the attempt.

Example logic:

If `$page === 'Menubar'`, then:

- For each `$pattern` in `$ng_patterns`:  
  - If `strpos($postdata, $pattern) !== false`:  
    - Log the incident using `error_log()`  
    - Stop execution with `die('This content cannot be saved (forbidden pattern detected).')`

— End inserted code —
